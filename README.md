# Predicting-House-Prices-using--linear--regression-


we performed an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a house price dataset and built a linear regression model to predict house prices.

We loaded and preprocessed the data, explored correlations and relationships using visualizations, selected relevant features based on EDA insights, built and trained a linear regression model, and evaluated its performance.

The linear regression model showed promise in predicting house prices based on the selected features. However, there is still room for improvement.

Further steps could involve trying different regression algorithms, fine-tuning hyperparameters, and engineering new features for better performance.

EDA and feature selection played a crucial role in understanding the data and building an initial predictive model
